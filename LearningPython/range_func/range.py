# The range() function
# When used in a for loop the range() function can be treated as a built-in function
# that returns an iterable object

# With one argument -> counts from 0 to stop
# range(stop)

# With two arguments -> counts from start to stop
# range(start, stop)

# With three arguments -> it counts from start to stop, with a defined step
# range(start, stop, step)
