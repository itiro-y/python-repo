# Multiprocessing example using pool

# not a big difference from the 5.943s of the same version of the code but without pool

# This Python multiprocessing helper creates a pool of size p processes. If you donâ€™t supply 
# a value for p, it will default to the number of CPU cores in your system, which is actually 
# a sensible choice most of the time.

# A CPU heavy calculation
