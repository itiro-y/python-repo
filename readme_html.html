        <p>
            The purpose of this repository is to show my self-study learning process in Python development 
            (from the basics to the more advanced concepts), and to demonstrate the tools I used to learn and 
            practice it. As well as, to organize ideias for future projects or anything that comes to mind.
        </p>
